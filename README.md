Discover Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in Python and how you can use them to make stock market predictions!






Warning: Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. This means that there are no consistent patterns in the data that allow you to model stock prices over time near-perfectly. Don't take it from me, take it from Princeton University economist Burton Malkiel, who argues in his 1973 book, "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," that if the market is truly efficient and a share price reflects all factors immediately as soon as they're made public, a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper stock listing should do as well as any investment professional.
